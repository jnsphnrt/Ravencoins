# My own Crypto currency
This is my (maybe bad) try to create my own crypto currency. It's just a fun Project. This will never be online available.
Hello, I am a german Student and this is my crypto currency.
It's not even close being a finished project. This is just the begining. I plan to write the
whole backend in Python. Maybe I will also design an Interface. This could be a very bad or a genius Idea ;)

This is the first project I publish on Github

# Languages
For the backend I try to do as much in Python as possible because I would like to learn this Language better with this project.
At this moment I have no Idea how I'm gonna design the Interface but we'll see.
